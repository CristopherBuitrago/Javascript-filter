## 💀 Encountering Issues?

If you encounter any problems, ensure that both Node.js and JSON Server are installed on your system.

1. ✅ Verify if Node.js is installed:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

2. ✅ Verify if JSON Server is installed:
   ```bash
   json-server --version
   ```

If either Node.js or JSON Server is not installed on your system, you can follow this video tutorial to install them:
